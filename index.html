            <h2>Eternal pheonix</h2>
        <img src="_images/eternalphoenix.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="phoenix">
        <h2>Introduction </h2> 
        <p>The phoenix is an immortal bird that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again. While it is part of Greek mythology, it has analogs in many cultures, such as Egyptian and Persian mythology. Associated with the sun, a phoenix obtains new life by rising from the ashes of its predecessor. Some legends say it dies in a show of flames and combustion, while others that it simply dies and decomposes before being born again. In the Motif-Index of Folk-Literature, a tool used by folklorists, the phoenix is classified as motif</p>
        <h2>Goals and Purpose</h2>
        <p>First of all getting the associate degree in software developer it s kind of the biggest 
            challenge of my career.It s a difficult path in every sense of the word.Daily I have to find new tips new skills
            to overcome this challenge.For example sometimes I have to google some terms to know what they means how to use them and when to us them.
            Also must of the time I have to go to youtube to search videos where I can get more examples and explanations.
        </p>
        <h2>Expectations</h2>
        <p>Like I said on my first post in the student  forum I hope we can all succeed and help one in other
            cause sometimes we can be in a rush to submit an assigment while we need help to complete the assigment but
             the teacher isnt aivalable in that particular time.So help can come from another student.
