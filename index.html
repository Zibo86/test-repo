    <h2 class="souligner"> Introduction</h2>
    <p>The phoenix is an immortal bird that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again. While it is part of Greek
      mythology, it has analogs in many cultures, such as Egyptian and Persian mythology. Associated with the sun, a
      phoenix obtains new life by rising from the ashes of its predecessor. Some legends say it dies in a show of flames
      and combustion, while others that it simply dies and decomposes before being born again.[1] In the Motif-Index of
      Folk-Literature, a tool used by folklorists, the phoenix is classified as motif B32.[2]

      The origin of the phoenix has been attributed to Ancient Egypt by Herodotus and later 19th-century scholars, but
      other scholars think the Egyptian texts may have been influenced by classical folklore. Over time, the phoenix
      motif spread and gained a variety of new associations; Herodotus, Lucan, Pliny the Elder, Pope Clement I,
      Lactantius, Ovid, and Isidore of Seville are among those who have contributed to the retelling and transmission of
      the phoenix motif. Over time, extending beyond its origins, the phoenix could variously "symbolize renewal in
      general as well as the sun, time, the Roman Empire, metempsychosis, consecration, resurrection, life in the
      heavenly Paradise, Christ, Mary, virginity, the exceptional man, and certain aspects of Christian life".[3] Some
      scholars have claimed that the poem De ave phoenice may present the mythological phoenix motif as a symbol of
      Christ's resurrection.[4]</p>
    <h2 class="souligner"> Depictions</h2>
    <p>The phoenix is sometimes pictured in ancient and medieval literature and medieval art as endowed with a halo,
      which emphasizes the bird's connection with the Sun.[15] In the oldest images of phoenixes on record these
      nimbuses often have seven rays, like Helios (the Greek personification of the Sun).[16] Pliny the Elder[17] also
      describes the bird as having a crest of feathers on its head,[15] and Ezekiel the Dramatist compared it to a
      rooster.[18]

      The phoenix came to be associated with specific colors over time. Although the phoenix was generally believed to
      be colorful and vibrant, sources provide no clear consensus about its coloration. Tacitus says that its color made
      it stand out from all other birds.[19] Some said that the bird had peacock-like coloring, and Herodotus's claim of
      the Phoenix being red and yellow is popular in many versions of the story on record.[20] Ezekiel the Tragedian
      declared that the phoenix had red legs and striking yellow eyes,[18] but Lactantius said that its eyes were blue
      like sapphires[21] and that its legs were covered in yellow-gold scales with rose-colored talons.[22]

      Herodotus, Pliny, Solinus, and Philostratus describe the phoenix as similar in size to an eagle,[23] but
      Lactantius and Ezekiel the Dramatist both claim that the phoenix was larger, with Lactantius declaring that it was
      even larger than an ostrich.[24]

    <h2 class="souligner">Apparences</h2>
    <p>According to Pliny the Elder, a senator Manilius (Marcus Manilius?) had written that the phoenix appeared at the
      end of each Great Year, which he wrote of "in the consulship of Gnaeus Cornelius and Publius Licinius", that is,
      in 96 BC, that a cycle was 540 years, and that it was 215 into the cycle (i.e. it began in 311 BC).[25] Another of
      Pliny's sources, Cornelius Valerianus, is cited for an appearance of the phoenix in 36 AD "in the consulship of
      Quintus Plautius and Sextus Papinius".[25] Pliny states that a purported phoenix seen in Egypt in 47 AD was
      brought to the capital and exhibited in the Comitium in time for the 800th anniversary of the foundation of Rome
      by Romulus, though he added that "nobody would doubt that this phoenix was a fabrication".[25]

      A second recording of the phoenix was made by Tacitus, who said that the phoenix had appeared instead in 34 AD "in
      the consulship of Paulus Fabius and Lucius Vitellius" and that the cycle was either 500 years or 1461 years (which
      was the Great Year based on the Egyptian Sothic cycle), and that it had previously been seen in the reigns first
      of Sesosis, then of Amasis, and finally of Ptolemy (third of the Macedonian dynasty).[28] A third recording was
      made by Cassius Dio, who also said that the phoenix was seen in the consulship of Quintus Plautus and Sextus
      Papinius.[29]
